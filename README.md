## 🎥 YouTube Course – Introduction to Data Structures & Algorithms

As I continued exploring computer science, I wanted to strengthen my understanding of core problem-solving concepts and share that knowledge with others.  
I created a beginner-friendly YouTube course on Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) to help new programmers build a strong foundation for coding interviews, competitive programming, and real-world development.  
Explaining each topic reinforced my own learning while helping others grasp the building blocks of coding.

**In this course, viewers learn:**
- ✅ What data structures are and why they matter  
- ✅ Arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues explained simply  
- ✅ Sorting algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)  
- ✅ Basics of trees and binary trees  
- ✅ How recursion works and why it’s powerful  
- ✅ Understanding Big-O Notation (time and space complexity)

✨ Whether you’re a high school student, beginner programmer, or aspiring software engineer, this course makes complex ideas approachable through clear explanations and visual examples.
